            <h1>Audio Editing</h1><a>The longest night of the year is about to start. Mrs H unfolds pieces of fabric she have been storing for this moment. She tears a piece of this gauzy fabric and cut one piece, then another, and few more. The old sewing machine in the attic awaits for this night every time after accumulating some dust within time. Then the well conserved engine starts putting the pieces of fabric together, each one takes its right place, until oh oh!, one is bigger than it should be. Nothing that few more cuts cannot fix. She moves on to have her creation ready as the requester of the piece waits for it.<br> The piece is ready!. Is time for the requester to wear it on, it fits perfect. It rips a little bit as the requester is in a rush, but that small detail is ignored. Mrs Hunsticks the Velcro, pulls the zipper on and sticks the Velcro around the neck. Shoes and accessories are wear on to be ready to go. One little impulse out of the seat to walk to the door. The person turns off the lights before leaving the room and closes the door. Our main character walks downstairs in a rush to get out of the house as quick as possible.<br> Now in the street, with difficulties to run with new clothes, reaches the loud crowd that has gathered at the end of the street, suddenly a different direction is taken. The main character approaches the old house in the corner. The garden is not very minded, is necessary walking over the weed before reaching the door-bell. The inpatient character also knocks at the door. Somebody is coming to open the old door. The old habitant has been waiting for her. Just that morning the little kid was excitedly telling the old lady about her Halloween costume, and promised to be go at hers first that night and scream the traditional ‘Trick or treat!’Happy Halloween!</a>
