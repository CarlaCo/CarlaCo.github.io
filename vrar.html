            <h1>VR/AR</h1><a>From the Netflix Serie, Squid Game, this concept takes one of the games that is played in the show. “The Glass Bridge”. In the Netflix show, the players have to jump either in one template glass or a normal glass. The first one would resist the weight of the player or even two players at the same time. But if they jump in the normal glass it will break and they would not play anymore. The aim is to reach the platform on the other side within a period of time where the player has to make this desicion as many times as pieces of glass there are.<br>
            The players, in the show are invited to play this game by receiving an invitation card. In the back of the card there is a phone number which the players would have to call if deciding to join the games. For this project the idea was to use the invitation card as an AR target, and a QR code in the back that would direct the players to the AppStore encouranging the users to download it and play the GlassBridge game.
