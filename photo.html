Also the lights in the background show up some joy reenforcing this message.</div>
        <div class="internalcontainerR"><h3>Look</h3><img class="dasimages" src="IMG_0556-LOOK.jpg" width="100%">This image of the look sign when crossing the streets is related to life in a way on how to mind it. It warns pedestrians to pay attention properly to avoid accidents. Specially at night that people could be distracted in many ways.</div>
