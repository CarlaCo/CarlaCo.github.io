            <h1>Video Editing</h1><a>The Video assignment will be an add style proposal of the JBL Pulse4 Portable speaker. The idea is developed through a timeline based in the beats of the background sound. The story is divided in three main stages, the revelation of the product, the attributes highlights and then the experiences that users can have with the products. At some point the timeline would break and reproduce an alternative soundtrack that contrasts with the previous one. Then we will be back to the main sound track background. <br>Finally, after all attributes and experiences that we have shown, the speaker will ran out of battery. That would introduce the final scene where it will be charging again. With that final scene we want to tell that the. product is getting ready to go for all those experiences again.<br>The attributes to be considered are the lights that displayed while playing music, the physical inputs to interact with the product, its portability and how it can be used with to play whatever you want, whenever you want, wherever you want and with anyone you want. This last part would show how to personalise its usability.
